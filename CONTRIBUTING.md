```
6. Make your changes. Make your changes to the website and commit them to your branch.

10. Create a pull request. Once your changes are pushed to GitHub, you can create a pull request to submit them for review. To do this, click the Pull requests tab on your repository page and click the New pull request button.

11. Wait for review and approval. Once you've created a pull request, the maintainers of the repository will review your changes. If they approve your changes, they will merge them into the main branch.
